	// Random number generators need a seed value to start

	// automatically generated from the system clock (or the
	// operating system's random number pool if available).
	// Alternatively we could provide our own seed. Each
	// seed uniquely determines the sequence of numbers that
	// will be produced.  We can replicate a sequence by
	// starting another generator with the same seed.
	
	MTRand mtrand2a( 1973 );  // makes new MTRand with given seed

	// But there are only 2^32 possible seeds when we pass a
	// single 32-bit integer.  Since the seed dictates the
	// sequence, only 2^32 different random number sequences
	// will result.  For applications like Monte Carlo
	// simulation we might want many more.  We can seed with
	// 2^19937-1 different values if we use an array rather
	// than a single integer.

	// Again we will have the same sequence every time we
	// run the program.  Make the array with something that

	// a unique sequence from /dev/urandom.

	// random numbers.  Otherwise the internal state of
	// the generator can be learned after reading 624
	// values.

	// an arbitrary point after seeding so a sequence
