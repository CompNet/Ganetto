Extract the gzipped tar archive, run 'make' to compile and, for example, './infomod 345234 MultiphysChemBioEco40_unweighted_undir.net 10' to run the code:

tar xzvf infomod.tgz
cd infomod
make
./infomod 345234 MultiphysChemBioEco40_unweighted_undir.net 10

Here ./infomod is the name of the executable, 345234 is a random seed (can be any positive integer value), MultiphysChemBioEco40_unweighted_undir.net is the network to partition (in Pajek's .net format), and 10 is the number of attempts to partition the network (can be any integer value equal or larger than 1). 

The code writes the results to two plain text files. The partition file with extension .clu, which gives the cluster assignments, can be used together with the original network to show the clusters in Pajek (import both files and use the command Draw->Draw-Partition in Pajek). The file .mod is an enumeration of all members of each cluster. Please send an e-mail to martin.rosvall@physics.umu.se if you encounter any problems.
